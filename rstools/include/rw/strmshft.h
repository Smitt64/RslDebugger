 ***************************************************************************
 *
 * The following macros are provided for use when compilers complain of
 * ambiguity between RWvostream,Collectable and RWderivedStream,builtin.
 * Rogue Wave "vstreamable" class headers now use these macros to provide
 * complete dis-ambiguation for the streams and classes that ship with
 * the Tools.h++ library.
 *
 * Since the functions are global inlines, the macros should be expanded
 * in a header file that can be #included only once per compilation unit.
 * 
 *  // Here is an example
 *  // You need not provide a full declaration of the stream class here
 *  class RWExport myOStream; // derived from RWvostream
 *
 *  // You need not provide a full declaration of the insertable class here
 *  class RWExport myClass;   // can be inserted into an RWvostream
 *
 *  // use the macro to provide an inline definition of the << operator
 *  RW_PROVIDE_DVSTREAM_INSERTER(myOStream,myClass)
 *
 * Similar code can be used to provide extractor methods.
