/*
 * RWDecimalBase class
 *
 * The basic use of this class is to provide a scope for the enums used
 * in the different RWDecimal classes.
 *
 * The member state_ would, in a pure design sense, be better included with
 * each individual RWDecimal class so that RWDecimalBase existed purely for
 * scoping.  The trouble with a class purely for scoping is that the compiler
 * will put a dummy variable in it to give it non-zero size.  Obviously, this
 * just won't do, so state_ is included since it is used in all the decimal
 * classes anyway.
